## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I love being organized and having my ideas sorted out for me. For months, I have a kept a note on my phone of all the restaurants in Saint Louis that I would like to try. When I would try them, I would add them to a new list marked either “good” or “bad.” What better way to sort these lists than a new app that will do it for me? 

My app will allow a user to make a “to-do” list of restaurants to try in the area (or elsewhere). Once the user has been to the restaurant, they can check the restaurant off their list and rate it. In essence, they will be creating a directory of restaurants they like and don’t like. Users will be able sort their to-do lists by type of food, priority, or alphabetical order. Additionally, if a user tries to add a new restaurant to their list which they have already tried, the application will let them know. When rating a restaurant, they can add their own personal notes about their experience. If a user has already tried a restaurant that was not on their to-do list originally but would still like to add it to their “directory,” they have the option to do that as well. The point of this app is to keep a simple running list of restaurants you want to try, restaurants you would go back to, and restaurants you would not.
